# game_shooting-birds
My own version of the game of shooting birds

**player's mission:**
- shoot down as many light birds as possible in one minute <br />

**player's rating:**
- 25 points for shooting down small objects (small flowers, small birds) or
- 10 points for shooting down other objects (flowers, birds),
- points are deducted, if the player shoots down a dark bird

**player's options:**
- left-click on labels (switching between game scenes - frames)
- left-click on shooting objects (shoot down objects)
- right-lick or arrow UP (reload bullets)
- move the mouse from left to right or arrow LEFT and RIGHT
    (looking around the landscape), arrow DOWN (to stop looking around)
- key SPACE (the game round is temporarily stopped)
